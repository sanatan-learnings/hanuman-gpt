## 5. Literal Translation

In your hand shine the mace and flag, and on your shoulder rests the sacred thread.

## 6. Interpretive Meaning

The mace (gada) represents Hanuman's warrior aspect and his power to destroy evil. The flag symbolizes victory and dharma. The sacred thread (janeu) is significant - despite being born in a monkey form, Hanuman was a Brahmachari (celibate) and a learned scholar who deserved the sacred thread worn by the twice-born.

## 7. Story Behind the Verse

Hanuman received extensive education from Surya (the Sun God) himself. He mastered the Vedas and scriptures, earning the right to wear the sacred thread. This challenges social hierarchies, showing that spiritual attainment transcends birth. His mace was a weapon he used to protect dharma during the Ramayana war.

## 9. Practical Application

**Key Teaching:**
True worthiness comes from knowledge, devotion, and character - not from birth or social status.

**When to Use This Verse:**
Recite this verse when you need to remember that spiritual attainment is available to all who seek it sincerely, regardless of their background.
