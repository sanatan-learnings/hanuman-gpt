## 6. Interpretive Meaning

Being Rama's messenger (doot) is Hanuman's most cherished identity - his entire existence is devoted to serving Rama. His incomparable strength isn't for personal glory but for divine service. His dual parentage (Anjani as mother and Vayu as spiritual father) signifies both earthly and divine origins.

## 7. Story Behind the Verse

Hanuman's birth itself was miraculous. Anjana, a celestial nymph cursed to be born as a monkey, prayed for a divine child. Vayu (wind god) played a role in his birth, giving Hanuman the speed and power of wind. His identity as "Ram Doot" was cemented when he crossed the ocean to find Sita in Lanka.

## 9. Practical Application

True strength is found in selfless service to a higher purpose, not in personal achievement or glory.

**When to Use This Verse:**
Recite this verse when you need to remember your purpose in serving others or a higher cause, or when you need incomparable strength to fulfill an important duty.
