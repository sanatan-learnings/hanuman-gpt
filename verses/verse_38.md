## 5. Literal Translation

Whoever recites this a hundred times is freed from bondage and attains great happiness.

## 6. Interpretive Meaning

"Sat baar" (hundred times) need not be literal; it represents devoted, repeated recitation. "Bandi" (bondage) can mean physical imprisonment or metaphorical bondage - to habits, karma, suffering. The promise of "maha sukh" (great happiness) following freedom indicates not just release from problems but positive fulfillment. This verse encourages regular practice.

## 7. Story Behind the Verse

Many devotees recite Hanuman Chalisa 100 times (called "Hanuman Chalisa Shatpath") during times of extreme difficulty. Stories tell of literal prisoners being freed, but more commonly, people report freedom from mental bondage, addictions, chronic problems, or seemingly impossible situations. The practice combines faith, focus, and time investment, all of which contribute to transformation.

## 9. Practical Application

**Key Teaching:**
Dedicated, repeated recitation of the Chalisa (100 times) can break all forms of bondage and bring great happiness.

**When to Use This Verse:**
Recite this verse when contemplating a 100-time recitation practice to overcome major obstacles or achieve liberation from persistent problems.
