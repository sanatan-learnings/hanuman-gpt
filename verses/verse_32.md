The elixir of devotion to Rama is with you; may you always remain Rama's servant.

## 6. Interpretive Meaning

"Ram rasayan" is the ultimate elixir - not a physical potion but the nectar of devotion to Rama. Hanuman possesses this completely. The wish "sada raho... ke dasa" is interesting - wishing for Hanuman to remain a servant seems paradoxical, but it recognizes that servitude to Rama is Hanuman's highest joy. This teaches that true fulfillment lies in devoted service.

## 7. Story Behind the Verse

Hanuman is eternally devoted to Rama - when offered any boon, he always asks to remain Rama's servant. Once when offered moksha (liberation), he declined, choosing instead to remain wherever Rama's name is sung. This verse reflects Hanuman's own choice and blesses him to continue in his chosen role, which brings him the greatest joy.

## 9. Practical Application

**Key Teaching:**
The highest fulfillment comes not from liberation or rewards, but from eternal, joyful service to the divine.

**When to Use This Verse:**
Recite this verse when you need to remember that true happiness lies in devoted service, not in personal achievement or liberation.
