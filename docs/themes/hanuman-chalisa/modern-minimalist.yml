  # ===== Design Philosophy =====
  philosophy: |
    This theme represents a bridge between ancient devotional tradition and
    contemporary visual language. By embracing modern minimalism while honoring
    traditional iconography, it makes the timeless wisdom of the Hanuman Chalisa
    accessible to digital-native audiences worldwide.

    The luminous, radiant quality of each image aims to evoke the actual
    experience of divine darshan (viewing of the sacred), not merely illustrate
    stories. Each composition is designed to support meditation, inspire devotion,
    and create a visual sanctuary for spiritual contemplation.

    The consistent use of saffron-gold tones creates a unified spiritual
    atmosphere while honoring the color's deep significance in Hindu tradition
    as the shade of sacred fire, renunciation, and spiritual awakening.
