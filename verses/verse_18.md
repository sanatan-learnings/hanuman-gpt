## 5. Literal Translation

The sun, located thousands of yojanas away, you leaped toward it, thinking it was a sweet fruit.

## 6. Interpretive Meaning

This verse recalls Hanuman's childhood innocence and fearlessness. The astronomical distance (yuga sahasra yojana = immense) and the identification of the blazing sun as a "sweet fruit" shows childlike wonder combined with extraordinary power. It teaches that innocence and power can coexist, and that great souls show their uniqueness even in childhood.

## 7. Story Behind the Verse

As a baby, Hanuman saw the rising sun and, thinking it was a ripe mango, leaped toward it to eat it. He flew across the sky, causing panic among the gods. When Indra struck him with his thunderbolt, Hanuman fell, and Vayu (his father) withdrew all air from the universe in anger. The gods then blessed baby Hanuman with various boons to appease Vayu. This story explains both his name (Hanu = jaw, Man = prominent/disfigured) and his many divine powers.

## 9. Practical Application

**Key Teaching:**
Fearlessness combined with innocence and wonder are signs of extraordinary potential - what seems impossible to others may be natural to those with divine purpose.

**When to Use This Verse:**
Recite this verse when you need courage to attempt something that seems impossibly distant or difficult, or when you want to approach challenges with childlike fearlessness.
