## 6. Interpretive Meaning

This verse showcases Hanuman's ability to transform according to need. The tiny form showed gentleness and the need to comfort Sita without frightening her. The gigantic form demonstrated power to instill fear in enemies. This teaches adaptability - using the right approach for different situations, always in service of dharma.

## 7. Story Behind the Verse

When Hanuman found Sita in Ashok Vatika, he made himself small (some say thumb-sized) to approach her gently, as she was already traumatized. After delivering Rama's message, when challenged by Ravana's forces, he grew enormous, allowing himself to be captured but then setting Lanka ablaze with his burning tail, demonstrating that he could destroy the kingdom even while bound.

## 9. Practical Application

**Key Teaching:**
Adaptability in approach - being gentle with those who need comfort and fierce with those who oppose righteousness - is a sign of true wisdom.

**When to Use This Verse:**
Recite this verse when you need to adapt your approach to different situations, showing gentleness or strength as circumstances require.
