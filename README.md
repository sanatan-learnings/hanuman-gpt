_May Lord Hanuman's blessings be with all who study and recite these sacred verses._

## Project Overview

This project presents a detailed, verse-by-verse exploration of the Hanuman Chalisa, one of the most revered devotional hymns in Sanatan Dharma (Hinduism). Composed by the 16th-century poet-saint Goswami Tulsidas, the Hanuman Chalisa consists of 40 verses (chaupais) that glorify Lord Hanuman's virtues, strength, and unwavering devotion to Lord Rama.

## Purpose

This comprehensive guide aims to make the Hanuman Chalisa accessible and meaningful to devotees, scholars, and seekers from all backgrounds by providing:

- Deep understanding of each verse's meaning and significance
- Practical applications for modern life
- Cultural and scriptural context
- Proper pronunciation and recitation guidance
- Devotional insights for spiritual growth
