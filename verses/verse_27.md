## 6. Interpretive Meaning

This verse beautifully captures Rama's dual nature - he was both a renunciate (tapasvi) and a ruler (raja), representing the ideal of dharmic kingship. Hanuman's role as the one who accomplishes "all" of Rama's tasks emphasizes perfect service. It teaches that serving the highest (Rama) is the highest achievement.

## 7. Story Behind the Verse

Despite being a prince and king, Rama lived with the simplicity and discipline of an ascetic. He honored his father's word by accepting exile and lived in the forest practicing austerities. Hanuman recognized this unique combination of renunciation and power, and devoted himself completely to Rama's service, never seeking anything for himself.

## 9. Practical Application

**Key Teaching:**
The highest service is to serve the highest ideal - one who combines power with renunciation and dharma with action.

**When to Use This Verse:**
Recite this verse when you need to dedicate yourself fully to serving a higher purpose or ideal, combining action with spiritual discipline.
