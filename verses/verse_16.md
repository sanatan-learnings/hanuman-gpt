This teaches that true service means creating connections that benefit all.

## 7. Story Behind the Verse

Sugriva was living in exile on Rishyamukh mountain, having been driven away by his brother Vali who also took his wife. When Hanuman first met Rama and Lakshmana, he recognized their divine nature and brought them to Sugriva.
