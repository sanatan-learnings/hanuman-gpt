### Regenerating Embeddings (For New Languages)

The spiritual guidance feature uses pre-computed embeddings. To regenerate them (e.g., when adding new language translations):

```bash
# Set up Python virtual environment (first time only)
python3 -m venv venv
./venv/bin/pip install sentence-transformers

# Generate embeddings locally (FREE, no API needed)
./venv/bin/python scripts/generate_embeddings_local.py

# Output: data/embeddings.json (~1.1MB)
```

**Cost:** FREE - runs locally on your machine, no API calls required!
