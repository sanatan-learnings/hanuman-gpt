  # ===== Design Philosophy =====
  philosophy: |
    This theme introduces children to the profound spiritual teachings of the
    Hanuman Chalisa through a visual language they understand and love - bright,
    playful, storybook illustration. By presenting these sacred stories in a
    child-friendly format, we plant early seeds of spiritual awareness and
    cultural connection.

    Every image is designed to be both educationally valuable and emotionally safe.
    Hanuman appears as a strong but friendly hero whom children can admire and
    emulate. Complex theological concepts are presented through simple, clear
    visual metaphors that children can grasp intuitively.

    The bright, joyful color palette creates an inviting atmosphere where children
    feel welcome to explore, ask questions, and learn. This is not about dumbing
    down sacred content, but rather presenting timeless wisdom in a form that
    respects children's developmental stage while honoring the spiritual depth
    of the original text.

    Parents and educators can use these images as conversation starters, helping
    children understand values like courage, devotion, wisdom, and service through
    Hanuman's example. Each image is a doorway to deeper discussion, making the
    Hanuman Chalisa accessible to the youngest generation of devotees.
