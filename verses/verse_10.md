Hanuman's "Bhima roop" (terrifying form) was reserved for enemies of dharma. This verse emphasizes that compassion and fierceness can coexist - be gentle with the righteous, fierce with the wicked. All actions were to perfect Rama's mission, showing selfless service without seeking personal credit.

During the Ramayana war, Hanuman killed many powerful demons including Akshay Kumar (Ravana's son), fought Ravana's brother Kumbhakarna, and wreaked havoc in the enemy ranks. Yet he always attributed victory to Rama's grace, never to his own power. He accomplished every task given to him, from finding Sita to bringing the Sanjeevani herb.

Righteous action requires the courage to be fierce against evil while remaining humble and attributing success to divine grace.
