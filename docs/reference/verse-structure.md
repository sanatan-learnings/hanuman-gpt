# Verse Structure Guide

This document explains the YAML-based structure used for each verse in the Hanuman Chalisa guide.

## Architecture Overview

Each verse is stored as a markdown file with **YAML front matter only** (no markdown body). All content is structured as data, and the Jekyll template (`_layouts/verse.html`) handles all formatting and presentation.

**Benefits:**
- Change template once, affects all 43 verses
- Clean separation of data and presentation
- Easy to maintain and update
- Consistent formatting across all verses

## File Location

All verse files are in the `_verses/` directory (Jekyll collection):
- `_verses/doha_01.md`, `doha_02.md`
- `_verses/verse_01.md` through `verse_40.md`
- `_verses/doha_closing.md`

## YAML Structure

Each verse file contains only YAML front matter with the following fields:

```yaml
---
layout: verse
title: "Verse 1: Ocean of Knowledge and Virtues"
verse_number: 1
previous_verse: "/verses/doha_02"
next_verse: "/verses/verse_02"

devanagari: |
  जय हनुमान ज्ञान गुन सागर।
  जय कपीस तिहुं लोक उजागर।।

transliteration: |
  Jai Hanuman Gyaan gun saagar
  Jai Kapis Tihun lok ujagar

phonetic_notes:
  - word: "हनुमान"
    phonetic: "ha-nu-maan"
    emphasis: "last syllable"
  - word: "ज्ञान"
    phonetic: "gyaan"
    emphasis: "syllable"

word_meanings:
  - word: "जय"
    roman: "Jai"
    meaning: "victory/hail"
  - word: "हनुमान"
    roman: "Hanuman"
    meaning: "Lord Hanuman"
  - word: "ज्ञान"
    roman: "Gyan"
    meaning: "knowledge/wisdom"

literal_translation: "Hail Hanuman, ocean of knowledge and virtues. Hail the lord of monkeys, who illuminates the three worlds."

interpretive_meaning: "Hanuman is described as an ocean - limitless and deep in wisdom and virtues. The three worlds (heaven, earth, and the netherworld) represent all of existence, and Hanuman's divine presence brings light to all realms."

story: "Hanuman was blessed by various gods with knowledge and power. As a child, he mistook the sun for a fruit and tried to swallow it, demonstrating his fearlessness. Despite his monkey form, he mastered all scriptures and became a scholar."

practical_application:
  teaching: "True greatness combines knowledge and virtues, and divine wisdom illuminates all aspects of life without discrimination."
  when_to_use: "Recite this verse when seeking wisdom and enlightenment, or when you need to remember that learning and virtuous qualities are limitless like the ocean."

## How the Template Renders Content

The `_layouts/verse.html` template processes the YAML data:

## Editing Verses

**Edit Template:** Modify `_layouts/verse.html` to change formatting for all 43 verses

**Edit Individual Verse:** Modify YAML in specific `_verses/*.md` file

**Add New Field:** Add to YAML in verses, then update template to display it

## Purpose of This Structure

1. **Maintainability** - Template changes affect all verses instantly
2. **Consistency** - All verses follow identical structure automatically
3. **Data Integrity** - YAML enforces proper structure
4. **Flexibility** - Easy to add new fields or change presentation
5. **Separation of Concerns** - Data (YAML) separate from presentation (template)
