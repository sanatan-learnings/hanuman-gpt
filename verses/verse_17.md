## 6. Interpretive Meaning

Hanuman's wisdom extended beyond physical strength to political and spiritual counsel. His advice to Vibhishana to abandon Ravana's adharmic path and join Rama was morally courageous guidance. This shows that true friendship means steering others toward righteousness, even when it's difficult.

## 7. Story Behind the Verse

Vibhishana, Ravana's younger brother, was dharmic and repeatedly advised Ravana to return Sita to Rama. When Ravana rejected his counsel, Vibhishana faced a difficult choice - loyalty to family or loyalty to dharma. Hanuman (and Rama) recognized his righteousness and welcomed him. After Ravana's death, Rama crowned Vibhishana as the king of Lanka. This story teaches that dharma transcends blood relations.

True wisdom means guiding others toward righteousness, even when it requires difficult choices that challenge family or social loyalties.

**When to Use This Verse:**
Recite this verse when you need courage to give moral guidance that might be unpopular, or when facing conflicts between loyalty and righteousness.
